# ASCII University Erciyes üéìüñ•Ô∏è

This was my very first project during the Programming course at Erciyes University, which makes it especially meaningful to me. 

## What It Does?

-Animates the phrase ‚ÄúERCIYES UNIVERSITESI‚Äù letter by letter in a random sequence using ASCII art.
-Uses the custom gotoxy() function for precise cursor positioning in the console window.
-Employs high-resolution timing via QueryPerformanceCounter() to achieve smooth and accurate animations.
-Demonstrates basic console graphics and animation techniques using ASCII character

## Technologies Used

- C (Standard + Windows-specific APIs)
- Console graphics (ASCII)
- Windows API: `SetConsoleCursorPosition`, `QueryPerformanceCounter`
- Custom timing functions ‚Äî implementing precise sleep function beyond standard Sleep()
- Console cursor manipulation: gotoxy()
- ANSI Escape Codes

## How to Run?

1. Run on a Windows system (Command Prompt or compatible terminal recommended).
2. Compile the source code with a compiler supporting Windows headers, such as GCC with MinGW:
3. Execute the program

Special thanks and greetings to my dear instructor, Prof. Alper Ba≈üt√ºrk.
